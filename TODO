debugger: when running after setting breakpoint: break at start
icd2: assert in progress when programming with icd2 debugger
direct: test read/write 16F and 18F with discontinuous area !!!
C18: cannot relate source lines to disassembly lines ?

TODO programmers:
* icd1/2: optimize programming: only program/verify what's necessary!!
* direct: alternate method to direct-program "Vdd first" chips (needed ?)
* pickit2: protocol for firmware 2.x
* support for other bootloaders (AN851, ...)
* look into xwisp2/avrdude
* pickit1/2: speed-up by not programming mask words and by programming 4/n words when possible...
* pickit2: now supports 16F886/887
* add promate2
* direct: support dsPIC
* add option to not autoload firmware (?)
* icd2: 12F609/615 16F610 16F677(debug) 16F88X 30F1010/2020/2023
        famid for 18J devices
* pickit2: configuration to set target voltage to different values (?)
* icd2: progress for firmware uploading
* psp: add 18F support
* psp: detection of programmer type (PSP, JuPIC, or Warp13)
* psp: for Warp13, there are some differences for 18F devices...

TODO debuggers:
* gpsim: add stopwatch feature + clock speed config
* icd2: fix 16FXXX debugging: init + reset + ...
* 18F1330-ICD ?
* icd2: how to read PORTB from 16F7X7
* device power toggle action: problem while running/debugging... (?)
* should be able to read/verify/blankcheck while debugging: restart debug: ask ?
* icd2: support more than one breakpoint for 18F
* advanced breakpoints (register, function, ...)
* add icd1 debugging
* support sdcdb (?)
* support ICD from CCS
* PIC30: no disassembly in disassembly listing

TODO interface:
* set breakpoint in disassembly listing, close, reopen: not displayed...
* escaping in string register entry
* add serial terminal
* add PC and goto PC in breakpoint list view (?)
* add "random/set_range/..." actions to each range in hex editor
* more filters in device selector
* undo/redo + better selection in hex editor
* .o view: more complete (?)
* renaming of source files
* COFF disassembly highlighting does not properly highlight multiline comments for C

TODO toolchains:
* support CC8E
* PICC: no need to compile and assemble in two steps for C files
* PICC: test debugging (from C or ASM files)
* mix different compiler and assembler in a project... (subproject ?)
* support for MPASM/MPLINK (mpasm freezes my version of wine...)
* error/warning filter for C30/PICC/JAL/C18
* syntax highlighting for JAL: highlight assembler blocks
* better syntax highlighting for Boost Basic
* PICC Lite windows executable crashes with wine
* support dsPICC: demo windows only and not working with wine
* support C2C, C2C++, P2C: exception in wine...
* support Proton Basic compiler
* library project: other toolchains ?
* JAL/JALV2/CC5X: use gputils to generate COFF file

TODO generators:
* fix cname generation for BSSEC/BSSIZ SSSEC/SSSIZ (none supported yet by gputils/sdcc ?)
* add missing template generators
* config generator: add/fix config names for gpasm/sdcc (18F) + picc + ...

TODO command-line:
* add "merge" commands to "piklab-hex"
* add utility to disassemble (?)

TODO misc:
* if CTRL+D in konsole: should restart it...
* check endianness: it should be alright since we are reading from hex file and outputing strings (?)
* add log settings: log file / timestamp
* allow saving hex to other formats
* shouldn't we always use the IHX32 format for devices 18 and up ???
* Vdd-frequency graphs ignore different osc/modes...
* code for UserId disassembly doesn't seem to be right...

DEVICES:
- finish checking device XML with XML Schema...
- make an automatic parser for file "gpprocessor.c" of gputils to extract coff codes.
- check list of devices against MPLAB for missing devices and discrepencies.
- config bits: check config bits from MPLAB
- vdd/freq: not sure I understand the Vdd range in 30F datasheets
- sometimes "vpp" depends on "vdd"...
- revision names...
- 16F630-ICD has lower Vdd requirements for read/write
- for 18F1230/1330 16F88X: Vdd-F graphs not available yet...
- 12F6XX-16F6XX-ICD have lower Vdd requirements for bulk erase
